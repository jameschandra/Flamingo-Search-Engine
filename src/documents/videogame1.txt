The Types of Video Games.
There are many different types of video games, and typically, they're categorized by their characteristics or underlying objectives—not 
by the type of gameplay they contain.
Game categories or genres, then, can also have subgenres, and many games fit into multiple genres!
Sure, it can be confusing, but by breaking down the game mechanics, we can start to understand how developers and publishers categorize 
their titles.
For example, if you’re an instant gratification type of gamer, action games are probably best. Do you like to solve puzzles or 
micro-manage resources? Real-time strategy games (RTSs) or role-playing games (RPGs) might be better suited for you.
But no matter what your interest, there is definitely a game genre that will appeal to your taste.
