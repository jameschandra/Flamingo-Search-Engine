Paleontology Explored.

Paleontology, also spelled palaeontology, scientific study of life of the geologic past that involves the analysis of plant and animal 
fossils, including those of microscopic size, preserved in rocks. It is concerned with all aspects of the biology of ancient life forms: 
their shape and structure, evolutionary patterns, taxonomic relationships with each other and with modern living species, geographic 
distribution, and interrelationships with the environment. Paleontology is mutually interdependent with stratigraphy and historical 
geology because fossils constitute a major means by which sedimentary strata are identified and correlated with one another. Its methods 
of investigation include that of biometry (statistical analysis applied to biology), which is designed to provide a description of the 
forms of organisms statistically and the expression of taxonomic relationships quantitatively.
