Reasons to Study Paleontology.

If the majority of what you know about paleontology comes from watching Jurassic Park, we’ve got news for you: it’s a lot more than 
just dinosaurs. National Geographic defines paleontology as “the study of the history of life on Earth as based on fossils.” This means 
the remains of everything from single-celled living things, fungi, and bacteria to plants and animals (and yes, dinosaurs). Read on for a 
roundup of three things to know about paleontology.

1. It’s very relevant

You may be wondering what’s the point of studying paleontology when there are so many other, seemingly more pressing, concerns. 
See, for example, all the times Friends character Ross, a professor in the subject, is mocked in the show for his passion and line 
of work. However, paleontologist Sarah Werning argues the field is a scientific necessity” that directly links to the modern world.

2. It has many career applications

While many paleontologists pursue careers in academia, there are other options as well. Some end up working as geological surveyors, 
while others work in the commercial sector for oil, coal, and gas companies. Others pursue fulfilling careers as museum curators, 
geoscientists, and oceanographers.

3. You’ll probably need a PhD
Regardless of the career path you choose to pursue as a paleontologist, if you plan to work within the field your journey will probably 
include a PhD.
