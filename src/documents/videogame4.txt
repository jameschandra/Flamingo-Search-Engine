COVID-19 Effects on Video Game.

As of April 20, all but five state governors have issued stay-at-home orders to slow the spread of the coronavirus. 
As approximately 95 percent of the population stays indoors, some are turning to video games to pass the time.
Senior Maria Gulino said in an interview with The News-Letter that she has spent more time playing video games since lockdown
 orders were instituted in Maryland. 
“Before coronavirus I played on the weekends,” she said. “Now I play everyday with my roommate. We get work done early so we play 
a lot more.”
Increased time spent playing video games has mirrored record-breaking sales of video game systems and accessories. According to The
 NPD Group’s monthly report, U.S. sales of the Nintendo Switch console doubled last month compared to March of last year. Playstation 4 
and Xbox One sales have also increased. Gulino said that, uncharacteristically, she bought four new video games in the past month.
