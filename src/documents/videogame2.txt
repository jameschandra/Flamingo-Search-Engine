Why Playing Video Games is Beneficial.
The last time I was unemployed was in the depths of the Great Recession. I had recently moved in with my girlfriend, 
who suddenly found herself with an out-of-work partner who rarely left the house. But she gave me some surprising
 advice: Play video games.
I would have a lot of time on my hands, she said, and while I could and should certainly do other things — housework, 
exercise, searching for a job — I would mostly be stuck at home with limited resources. Without something to occupy my mind, 
I’d go crazy.
She was right. Playing video games helped ease my mind, elevate my mood and possibly saved our relationship. This year we’ll
celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary.
