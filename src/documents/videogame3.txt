The Quick Rise of Video Games.
Video games were already growing in popularity before the coronavirus pandemic. But now they’re everywhere.
Gaming sales in the US in August increased 37% year-over-year to $3.3 billion, according to the market research firm NPD Group. 
That’s the fifth straight month of huge jumps in sales compared to the same periods in 2019.
After a “low” point of 26% growth in June, sales in the US have accelerated the past two months—a sign that video games continue to 
surge in popularity even as quarantines end and travel restrictions loosen.
In the year to date, $29.4 billion of video games have been sold in the US—a 23% increase from the same period last year. The majority 
of that increase has been in content (the games themselves, either bought digitally or on discs), but sales of hardware (consoles and 
accessories) have also seen double-digit increases since the pandemic began. Consumers are buying more consoles, and those who already 
have consoles are buying more games to play on them.
