What is Paleontology?
Paleontology is the study of ancient life; ancient life preserved as fossils.
During each of these years, over the whole world, the land and the water has been peopled by a host of living forms. What an 
infinite number of generations, which the mind cannot grasp, must have succeeded each other over the long roll of years! Now turn to our 
richest geological museums, and what a paltry display we behold! â€“ Charles Darwin, The Origin of Species

What is a fossil?

Fossils can be defined as any non-living, biological material that can be interpreted in the record of life on Earth. We use fossils as
data to make interpretations about the past. Fossils are incredibly important sources of information as they archive the past!
