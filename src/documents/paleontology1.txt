What is Paleontology.
Paleontology is the study of the history of life on Earth as based on fossils. Fossils are the remains of plants, animals, fungi, 
bacteria, and single-celled living things that have been replaced by rock material or impressions of organisms preserved in rock. 
Paleontologists use fossil remains to understand different aspects of extinct and living organisms. Individual fossils may contain 
information about an organismâ€™s life and environment. Much like the rings of a tree, for example, each ring on the surface of an oyster 
shell denotes one year of its life. Studying oyster fossils can help paleontologists discover how long the oyster lived, and in what 
conditions.
